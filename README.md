PyProcess 0.2
=============

PyProcess is a Python class library used to exactly simulate stochastic processes, and their properties.

Using this library, you can simulate the following random processes:

Continuous Diffusions
- Brownian Motion
- Geometric Brownian Motion
- CEV
- CIR
- Square Bessel Process 
- Ornstein Uhlenbeck process
- Time-integrated Ornstein Uhlenbeck process
- Levy Processes
- Bessel Process (coming soon)
- Fractional Brownian Motion (coming soon)

Jump Diffusions
- Gamma process
- Variance-gamma process
- Geometric Gamma process
- Inverse Gaussian process *NEW*
- Normal Inverse Gaussian process *NEW*

Step Processes
- Renewal process
- Poisson process
- Compound poisson process
- marked-poisson process
- Fractional poisson process (coming soon)


*See fun examples of the processes you can simulate [here] (http://pyprocess.70percentfatfree.com)*
